        An ID is an attribute, an identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page whereas the class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behaviour all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assiugned to multiple elements. If there are multiple classes of an element they are separated by space.
